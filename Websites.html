            <h2>Website with Php</h2>
            <h4>E-commerce shop: Sayur</h4>
            <p>This is a project that me and my groupmates have done as one of our assignments. 
                <br>It is project done using HTML and PHP.
            </p>

            <div>
                <video autoplay muted loop style="width: 50%; z-index: 2;">
                    <source src="Sayur.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
                </video>
            </div>
            <p>This project has allowed me to understand and gain knowledge on preparing a full stack development by using HTML for front-end
                and PHP for back-end. 
                <br>
                As seen above, the video portrays our user interface for customers to access and purchase products.
                <br>
                There is also another interface that allows the administration of the website to edit, insert and delete basically to 
                perform CRUD operations on the items registered in the website.
                <br>

                <br>
                This project allowed me to understand the integration between the front-end and back-end.
                <br>
                We achieved an A for this subject by incorporating some javascript as well to enable the shopping cart function.
