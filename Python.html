            <h4>Congkak</h4>
            <p>This is a project that me and my groupmates have done as one of our assignments. <br>It is a game
                played similarly to congkak and is
                coded using python.

            <p>This project has allowed me to understand and gain knowledge on the use of Data Structure and some
                Machine Learning to help optimize the user gameplay.
                <br>
                This project is done with data structure with the use of minimax algorithm by finding the shortest
                path to win.
                <br>
                In this case, is the hint function to allow the player to use the hint provided to win the game by
                finding the shortest path.
                <br>
                It is also a player vs player or player vs bot game which therefore involves Machine Learning.

                    old school game known as battleship.

                <p>This project is one of my very first project in my degree. <br>
                    This is where the first time I was introduced to programming language Python.<br>
                    Therefore, has allowed me to understand and gain knowledge on the use of functions and resuing code to optimize
                    the performance.
